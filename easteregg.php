						EPISODE IV<br>
						A NEW HOPE FOR MEMORY RETENTION</p>
					<p>Memory Swipe will improve and/or retain your memory 
						by playing a simple game.</p>
					<p>To play Memory Swipe, simply remember the order of numbers 
						when they appear. After the numbers disappear, 
						swipe from one number to the next.</p>
					<p>As you improve, you can increase the difficulty 
						the next time you play, and have to remember 
						more numbers to swipe.</p>
					<p>This game was created by Shawn Kim, Benjamin Hao, Kelvin Zheng, 
						Brayden Traas, and Yoshiaki Murakami.</p>
					<p>This game was inspired by the Android pattern lockscreen. 
						We are in no way affiliated with Android, Google,
